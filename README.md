## Overview
I always found it hard to learn lyrics of a song. This utility helps to split the songs on silence so that the chunks can be played in loop to familiarize the chunks. This utility also reduces the tempo to 80% of the original speed so that it is easier to learn the lyrics.

## Usage
`./split-song-on-silence.py <song-file-path>`

## Dependencies
* pydub (https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub)
